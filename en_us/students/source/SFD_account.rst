*********************************
Introducing edx.org and edX Edge
*********************************

EdX hosts courses on the `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_ websites.

* edx.org hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs), designed and led by edX
  institutional partners. Courses on edx.org are publicly listed for enrollment
  by learners from around the world.

* EdX Edge hosts small private online courses (SPOCs), which are often used to
  deliver course content to on campus students. Courses on Edge typically limit
  enrollment. Edge does not have a course catalog, so you must receive an
  invitation to enroll and participate in a course on Edge.

.. note::  The user accounts on edx.org and edX Edge are separate. If you take
   courses on both sites, you must complete the :ref:`account registration
   <Register on edX>` process separately for each site.


**********************
Browse Courses
**********************

You can browse for courses to take before you register or sign in.

On the `edx.org`_ website or on the edX mobile app, select **Find Courses**.

To reduce the number of courses shown, enter a search term in the **Search**
field or, on the `edx.org`_ website, select a subset of courses based on
availability or subject under **Refine your search**. On the edX mobile app,
select **Explore Subjects**.

Enroll in the courses that you want to take. For information about enrolling in
a course, see :ref:`SFD Enrolling in a Course`.


.. _Register on edX:

******************
Register on edX
******************

Before you create, or register, an edX account, note that course team members
and other learners see the name that you enter as your public username, not the
full name that you enter. You cannot change your public username after you
register.

To register an edX account, select **Register** on the edx.org site or in the
edX mobile. If you received a course invitation email message, follow the link
in that message, and then complete these steps.
